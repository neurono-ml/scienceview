# Tasks

## 1. Module, builder and composition

- [x] Write the failing tests first: the chart builds with its documented
  defaults, and each option changes the output.
- [x] Create `src/recipes/distribution/rug_plot/{mod.rs, builder.rs,
  core_implementation.rs}` following patterns.md P3; `mod.rs` is a pure
  dispatcher.
- [x] Implement the builder state machine, the required `backend(...)` and the
  default `execution_mode(...)`, with `SVRugPlot` carrying its configured kind.
- [x] Wire the composition `data -> [no stat] -> values -> [no move] -> [SVScale] -> SVMark::Line (segment geometry)` through the core kernels.

## 2. Data contract and parity

- [x] Write the failing parity test: dense, sparse and streaming input of the
  same data produce the same marks within the documented tolerance.
- [x] Implement the column resolution and the explicit error for a missing or
  mistyped column.
- [x] Verify a sparse input is never densified and a streaming input never
  blocks; assert the window behaviour where the recipe depends on it.

## 3. Concurrency and observability

- [x] Write the failing concurrency test for rendering the same figure from
  several threads.
- [x] Assert the operation span carries the backend kind, the representation
  and the point count.

## 4. Example and generated figure

- [x] Add `examples/rug_plot.rs` demonstrating the documented configuration.
- [x] Generate `docs/figures/rug_plot.svg` with `cargo run --example rug_plot` and
  verify the `figures` gate reports no drift.

## 5. Book chapter (book branch)

- [x] Create the documentation branch from `docs/documentations` and add the
  chapter under `docs/src/`.
- [x] Mirror the figure into `docs/src/assets/rug_plot.svg` and embed it in the
  chapter.
- [x] Register the chapter in `docs/src/SUMMARY.md` and verify `mdbook build`.

## 6. FDR and changelog

- [x] Change `docs/FDRs/distribution-rug-plot.md` status to `shipped`, linking the
  example and the chapter.
- [x] Add the `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

## 7. Acceptance

- [x] Run the four gates locally: `cargo fmt --all --check`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`, `cargo test --workspace`, and the
  figures check.
- [x] Open the ADR issue and reference it from both PRs with a closing keyword.
- [x] Trigger the independent acceptance review against
  `docs/FDRs/distribution-rug-plot.md` before opening the code PR. The review
  found and fixed three acceptance gaps: `height = 1.0` could push a tick into
  the plot rectangle (now capped at the margin depth), an all-missing column
  failed instead of rendering an empty scene (now falls back to the unit
  interval), and implicit sparse zeros widened the value axis although no tick
  was drawn there (the scale now derives from the drawn observations). The
  operation-span test was also stabilized against the shared tracing callsite.
